# White Label ATM Project

This project simulates the functionality and analysis of White Label ATMs (WLAs) using Python. It provides insights into ATM transaction data and trends with the help of data processing and visualization tools.

## 🚀 Features

- Data processing and analysis using **Pandas**
- Interactive data visualizations using **Matplotlib**
- Excel file handling with **xlrd**
- Clean and readable code written in **Python**
- Developed using **Sublime Text** as the code editor

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for logic and analysis
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting graphs and charts
- **xlrd**: For reading Excel files
- **Sublime Text**: Used as the development environment

## 📁 Project Structure

## 📊 How It Works

1. Reads and processes transaction data from an Excel file.
2. Uses Pandas for data transformation and cleaning.
3. Visualizes the results using graphs (line plots, bar charts) with Matplotlib.
4. Outputs the summary and analysis to the terminal and saves plots to disk.

## ✅ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib xlrd
